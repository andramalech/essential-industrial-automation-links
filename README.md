# Essential Industrial Automation Links

A curated list of essential automation links. Suggest a link with a PR or [open a new issue](https://github.com/factory-x/essential-industrial-automation-links/issues/new).

Links make the cut if they are about automation technology that is open, standards-based, secure, interoperable, innovative, fast to set up.
Reasons why links might not make the cut:

* No demo version available
* Closed system
* Proprietary standards
* Licensing based on tags and/or clients

## Required Reading (Online resources)
